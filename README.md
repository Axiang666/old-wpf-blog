# Bea's WPF blog
Here's a selection of posts from my WPF blog, written between 2005 and 2013. 

I took down the blog in 2016 because some of the information had become outdated and many of the links no longer worked. Maintaining the blog was no longer my priority once I started working with other technologies. After I removed the blog, I continued to receive requests for information on WPF. I shared many of the articles and code samples privately, and now I've decided it's time to make the articles and code available online. 

Note that the blog posts are shared "as is," with no guarantees that the samples still work with the latest versions of WPF, Silverlight, .NET, and Visual Studio. I hope they're useful to you nonetheless.
